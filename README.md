# Codes for estimating the parameters of frailty models for repairable systems under imperfect repair using hierarchical Bayesian methods

## The repository

This repository contains the codes implemented from the theory presented in Manuscript "Bayesian analysis of shared frailty models for repairable systems subject to imperfect repair", as well as the database used in that work and some supplementary files.

## Available files

* The codes from estimating parameter of frailty ARA_m models;
* The codes from estimating parameter of frailty ARI_m models;
* The dataset "truck_data" studied in the manuscript.
